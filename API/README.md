# How to work with the Database
Can you help me teach the bot different phrases.
The folder has two exe files, the Add_to_soc.exe adds information to the Database for AI training.

Example phrases:
- What is the weather now? @ search
- Hi @ Greetings

File mask: text @ type

---

The Add_to_an.exe expands the answer file.

Example phrases:
- Greetings @ Salute!
- Search @ That's what I found

File mask: type @ text

---

When you start the application, you write your options and where there should be an @ symbol put two spaces
Example:
- Hey__Greetings
- Ok__Affairs



# Classification

- All greetings @ Greetings
- Everything related to the state of the bot @ Affairs
- Searches @ Search
- To search the YouTube @ Youtube

More information can be found in the database files themselves.

Example of dialog:
```
---> Hey
<--- Hi
---> What's up?
<--- Very well

```

---

When you run the program, a text document is created in the folder where your records are located. To finish writing write the program "Save".
You can send the finished text file to my mail ameliepickdev@gmail.com
And in the next bot updates, I will expand the database with your entries.
