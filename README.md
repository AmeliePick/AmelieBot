**AmelieBot is a chat assistant for PC. Written in Python.
The program is based on a small neural network written in the sklearn module. This network classifies user input. Further, the type of the question is compared with the Database and the answer is given with some action (opening the application, etc.).**

# What can the bot


At the time of publication AmelieBot Alpha 2.0 (11/22/2018), the bot can:

1. Imitate communication a little
2. Find information on the Internet
3. Search YouTube Videos *ยน*
4. Work with OC (Open different applications)
***

The bot has two modes of operation:
- Voice control and voice response
- Just chat

Due to the fact that the bot still has a small database, it is not always able to correctly distinguish what was said / written to it.
(See below for more on this.)
***

# Work with applications.

Because a bot can open applications, it needs to know where the file being launched (.exe) is. In the published version 2.0, Bot needs to add the name of the program and specify the path to it. The bot himself will offer this if he does not find the program.

ยน- The bot has implemented * pure search * - cutting the phrase and searching within the meaning of the request. For example: Find guides on Python. The query will leave the entire phrase, except for the word "Find." On this built search in search engines and on YouTube. Again, in connection with a small Database, a clean search can incorrectly recognize the meaning of a phrase and add extra words to the search.
***

# Optimization issue
Initially, the bot was planned to be kept in the background. In trial tests, he occupied 57-58 MB in RAM with the included synthesis.
***

# Upcoming updates and project support.

1. In future updates, it is planned to increase optimization and reduce memory consumption in two bot modes.

2. Expand Database (willing to help with this, all links below)

3. Implement self-learning based on user requests

4. The code is far from perfect, so fixes of bugs will be released from time to time.
